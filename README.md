## Running the Script
It uses gpt-4o by default so you should have access to that to run it.

- **Configure Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Set up the environment variables for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and other tools as needed in '.env'.
- **Install Dependencies**: Run `poetry lock && poetry install`.
- **Execute the Script**: Run `poetry run medibot`.
